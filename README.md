# Resource-rational nudging

Data, modeling, and analysis from Mouselab nudging experiments. This includes the following experiments:

* Default options 
* Pre and post-choice suggestions
* Traffic light labeling
* Optimal nudging: modifying the initial belief state (i.e., setting some costs to zero)
* Optimal nudging: changing costs (i.e., reducing costs without setting them to zero)
