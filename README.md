# Optimal nudging for cognitively bounded agents: A framework for modeling, predicting, and controlling the effects of choice architectures

Data, modeling, and analysis for Mouselab nudging experiments. This includes the following experiments:

1. Default options 
2. Pre and post-choice suggestions
3. Traffic light labeling
4. Optimal nudging: modifying the initial belief state
5. Optimal nudging: changing costs
