Sufficient is hard to say, but it could be conceived of as the thought: \""This is the largest number in the highest point row to such an extent that high numbers in other rows for other baskets could not make up the difference *and* low numbers in this basket in the other rows could not make the difference between this basket and the others meaningful enough to risk losing more point clicks.\""\n\nIf the highest number in a basket is equal to or close to a number in another basket, you reveal the boxes in each of those baskets that correspond to the second-highest point value row.
